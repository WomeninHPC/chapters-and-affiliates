Blooming Good Ideas 
====================

* Event: [ARCHER2 Celebration of Science 2025](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/community/events/celebration-of-science-2025/)
* Contact: Eleanor Broadway (e.broadway@epcc.ed.ac.uk)

### Outcomes:

* Brainstorming ideas/strategies to solveÂ key challenges related to a certain topic (in this case it was HPC service delivery) 
* Demonstration that diversity in experiences/perspectives/skills is a strength that leads to better outcomes. Collaboration > competition.   
* Valuing all voices is integral to the success of the team, helping individuals gain confidence to share their ideas.  


Instructions: 
----------------

### Materials required per group (6-8): 
* ~30 Sticky dots 
* 1 sheet of [petals](A3-Petals.pdf) (cut out)
* 1 [flower](A3-Flower.pdf) sheet
* 8 x pens
 
### Blooming Good Ideas: 

* Each table is a discussion group. Each table has the materials to make a paper flower. Activity introduced and question(s) posed to the room.  
* By yourself: write your idea/answer on your petal and place into the flower. 
* Pair 1: Share with the person next to you, share your ideas, evolve and/or consolidate into one. Write it down on another petal and place into the flower.  
* Pair 2: Turn to the person on your other side, share your ideas, evolve and/or consolidate into one. Write it down on another petal and place into the flower. 
* Come together as a group, share all ideas, evolve them and write down the best/consolidated idea in the centre of your flower.  
* Share ideas with the room.   
* Wrap-up: how did you find brainstorming in this way?  

Considerations for successful questions: 
* Open ended, idea generation driven, actionable and useful change. 
* Relatable to everyone in the room.  


Lessons learned: 
----------------
* It was slightly confusing to explain but, once we got going, people really engaged! 
* 6 is the perfect number, 8 is doable but any bigger is too big. 
* See [Completed-Flowers-A2CoS25.pdf](Completed-Flowers-A2CoS25.pdf) for outcomes. 
* It takes a long time to cut the petals!!
