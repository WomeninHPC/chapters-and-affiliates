| `blooming-good-ideas` | Interactive brainstorming - evolve your thoughts and bloom good ideas! | Eleanor Broadway (e.broadway@epcc.ed.ac.uk) | 
| `edi-equation` | Discussing the design of future EDI iniatives, will certain changes make it more sustainable or impactful? For example: what if EDI was treated in the same way as exascale, and there was a race to be the first and the best?
