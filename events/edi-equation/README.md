The EDI Equation: Getting the Balance Wrong 
===========================================

* Event: [Durham HPC Days 2025](https://pay.durham.ac.uk/event-durham/durham-hpc-days-2025)
* Contact: Eleanor Broadway (e.broadway@epcc.ed.ac.uk)

### Outcomes:

* Discussion around the future of EDI initatives. How do we make them more sustainable, less reliant on volunteers and more impactful?
* Raising awareness of the over-reliance on volunteers and the need to make changes. 


Lessons learned: 
----------------
* The relation to current HPC challenges/popular topics (like exascale) was really engaging! 
* Always allocate more time than you think you need.
